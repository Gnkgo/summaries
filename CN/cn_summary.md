# Important stuff
## Internet

- Internet connects End Systems/ Hosts by a system of communications links and package switches
- Pakets: data segment and header
- IP (Internet Protoco): Specifies the format for packets sent among routers and end systems
- DSL (digital subscriber line): broadband residential access
- FDM (Frequency-division multiplexing): link dedicates a frequency band on the band to a communication for the duration of connection. The width of this band is called bandwidth.
- TDM (time-division multiplexing): time is divided into frames of fixes size, and each frame is split into a fixed amount of slots. These slots are dedicated to one connection

## Delays
- **nodal processing delay:** Time used to decode the header, determine which output needs to be used, bit level checking etc.
- **queuing delay:** Time that the packet has to wait in the queue until the desired output will be free
- **transmission delay:** Time after the packet gets out of queue until its on the output line; let L be the length of the packet, R the transmission rate from router A to B, then the transmission delay is L/R.
- **propagation delay:** Time, the package takes to propagate through the physical medium (e.g. at light speed with radio waves), i.e. it takes on the way from router A to B

## Layers

- **Application Layer:** Application protocols and layers reside here. The internet includes many protocols here, as HTTP (provides Web document requests and responses), SMTP (for e-mail transfer) and FTP (file transfer from host to host). The DNS is also an application layer protocol. Packet of information at this layer is called message

- **Transport Layer:** Transports application layer messages between application endpoints. In the internet, thereâ€™s TCP and UDP. E.g. longer messages are split into shorter segment. Packets in this layer are called segments.

- **Network Layer:** Packets in this layer are called datagrams. The layer is responsible for moving datagrams from host to host. It receives a segment and an address. This layer includes the IP, which defines the
fields in a datagram and how to work on those fields.

- **Link Layer:** The network layer brings a datagram from one node to another, but to move a packet from one specific node to another, it relies on the link layer. It delivers the packet to the next node. E.g. Ethernet or WiFi. Link layer protocols are called frames.

- **Physical layer:** The job of the link layer is to move whole frames from one node to another; however, the job of the physical layer is to move individual bits. Many protocols exist, depending on the physical medium; e.g. Ethernet has different protocols for different cable types.


## DNS servers
### Resource Records (RRs)
- **Type=A:** Name refers to a hostname, Value refers to the corresponding IP address. Hence, this type provides a standard hostname to IP mapping.
- **Type=NS:** Name is a domain (e.g. foo.com) and Value is the hostname of an authoritative DNS server who can how to obtain the IP address of the query.
- **Type=CNAME:** Value is the canonical host name for the alias host name Name.
- **Type=MX:** Value is the canonical name of a mail server
with alias Name.

## Quiz
- **The Maximum Segment Size(MSS) of TCP is equal to:**
MSS = MTU - header(IP) - headeer(TCP)

- UDP sockets type is SOCK_DGRAM while TCP sockets type is SOCK_STREAM
- For a SOCK_STREAM, an operating system stores both local and remote port
- Given a directed graph G(V, E) with |V| and |E| being the numbers of vertices and edges, how many variables do you need for the max-flow LP formulation discussed in class?
