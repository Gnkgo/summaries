\section{Pyramids and Wavelets}
\subsection*{Scale-space representations}
From an original signal $f(x)$ generate a parametric family of signals $f^+(x)$ where fine-scale information is successively suppressed \graytext{e.g. successive smoothing or image pyramids (smooth \& downsample)} \\
\greenbf{Applications:} Search for correspondence \graytext{(look at coarse scale, then refine with finer scale)} edge tracking \graytext{coarse to fine estimation} control of detail and computational cost \graytext{(e.g. textures)}\\
\greenbf{Example:} CMU face detection: need different scales for template to match.\\
\greenbf{Gaussian Pyramid:} Image pyramid with Gaussian for smoothing\\
\greenbf{Laplacian Pyramid:} Preserve difference between upsampled Gaussian pyramid level and Gaussian pyramid level. Like a band-pass filter - each level represents spatial frequencies that are largely unrepresented at other layers \graytext{Compression}.\\
\greenbf{Haar transform:} has two major sub-operations:
\begin{compactenum}
    \item scaling captures info at different frequencies
    \item translation captures info at different locations
\end{compactenum}
