## Lecture 1
- Data is not collected but created
    - numerous framework conditions, choices involved
    choices determine shape and informational value of data
- Putting "Science in Perspective"
- Complementing the "engineering mindset" with the "critical mindset"

## Lecture 2 
- hospitals/medical facilities produce massive amount of data (patients, diseases, therapy...)
- doctors, nurses, $\rightarrow$ create data about ambiguous phenomena and from inconclusive diagnostics

### Body Multiple (Mol 2002)
- investigates particular disease and treatments in different forms. (Long time research)
    - shadowing medical professionals
    - observing patient consultations
    laboratory work
    - attending meetings
    - conducting interviews
- different versions of the disease, question of 
    - coordination
    - distribution
    - inclusion that are caused by them
- different view on pain tolerance (experience of disease symptoms is unique)
- multiplicity as key concept

### Precobs
- check which house is getting robbed (data):
    - police reports
    - analyzed algorithmically on a daily basis

- focuses on residential burglary prediction

## Lecture 3
- classification evolves over time and in accordance with what society considers relevant and acceptable

### Classification system
- How to build boxes:
    - Important: classification systems are not obvious or self-evident
        - there are choices involved in how to build boxes
    - two ideal-typical ways:
        - Aristotelian classification
        - prototype classification

### Aristotelian Approach
- empirical
- top-down approach
- logic: binary characteristics that the object being classified either presents or does not present

### Prototype Approach
- not as used as often
- discursive approach
- comes from concepts that have already been established
- common sense category

### Conclusion
- Classification as compromise

## Lecture 4
- data infrastructures are digital means for storing information
    - key of individual and collective life
        - information exchange
        - communication
        - governance
        - economy
- increasing emergence of data infrastructures as business model themselves
    - webhosting, database service
    - platform economy
    - entertainment on demand
