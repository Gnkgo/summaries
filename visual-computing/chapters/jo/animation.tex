\section{Animation}
\greenbf{Applications:} entertainment, education, communication useful in robotics, computer vision engineering and scientific visualization.
\subsection*{Principles of animation:} 
Squash and stretch: \graytext{defining the rigidity \&mass of an object by distorting its shape during motion}\\
Motion: \graytext{Spacing actions to define the weight \& size of objects \& the personality of characters}\\
Anticipation: \graytext{Preparation of an action}\\
Staging: \graytext{Presenting an idea so that it is unmistakenly clear}\\
Follow through \& overlapping action, straight ahead action \& pose-to-pose action, slow in and outgoing
\subsection*{Generating motion:} 
artist-directed \graytext{(e.g. keyframing)}, datadriven \graytext{(e.g. motion capture)}, procedural \graytext{(e.g. simulation)}\\
\greenbf{Keyframing:} Specify important events only, computer fills in the rest via interpolation/approximation. Events can be position, color, light intensity, camera configuration.\\
\greenbf{Motion capture:} Track points, compute joint angles using inverse kinematics and use the angles for animation.
