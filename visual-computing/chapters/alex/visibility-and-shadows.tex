\section{Visibility \& Shadows}

\greenbf{Visibility:} Some parts of of some surfaces are occluded by other surfaces.

\greenbf{Painter's Algorithm:} Render objects/Polygons from furthest to nearest. Problem: cyclic overlaps and intersections.

\greenbf{Z-Buffering:} Store depth to the nearest object for each pixel. 1.Initially all $\infty$. 2. For each Polygon, if the z value of a pixel for this polygon is smaller than the stored z value, replace the stored z value. Problems: limited resolution (only finite number of z values), non-linear (higher resolution for near objects, lower for far objects), setting near plane far from camera exacerbates resolution problem.

\greenbf{Shadows:} Important for perception of depth, realism, indicating light position and type (point light or area light).\\

\greenbf{Planar Shadows}
    Draw projection on the ground.
  
    \textit{Limitations}:
    No self shadows or on other objects.
    Problems with curved surfaces.
  
  
  \greenbf{Projective texture shadows}
    Separate obstacle and receiver. Compute b/w image from light and use as projective texture.
  
    \textit{Limitations}:
    Need to specify obstacle \& receiver.
    No self-shadows.
  
  
    \greenbf{Shadow Maps}
  \begin{compactenum}
    \item Compute depths from light \(d(x_L)\) and camera.
    \item For each pixel in camera plane:
    \begin{compactenum}
      \item Compute point in world coordinates
      \item Project onto light plane \(z_L\)
      \item If \(d(x_L) < z_L\), then \(x\) is in shadow.
    \end{compactenum}
    \item Add bias for stability (\(d(x_L) + b < z_L\)).
    \item A point to shadow can be outside the FoV of shadow map, thus use cubical shadow map or spot lights.
    \item Should \textbf{not} filter depth, but take weighted average.
  \end{compactenum}
  
  \greenbf{Shadow Volumes}
  \begin{compactenum}
    \item Explicitly represent the volume of space in shadow. If polygon in volume, it is in shadow.
    \begin{compactenum}
      \item Shoot a ray from the camera
      \item ++/-- counter each time volume is intersected.
      \item if counter \(> 0\), then primitive is in shadow
    \end{compactenum}
  
    \item Use silhouette edges only!
  
    \item \textit{Limitations}:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item Lots of geometry
        \item Expensive to rasterize long skinny triangles
        \item Object must be watertight
        \item Rasterization of polygons sharing an edge must not overlap and not have gap.
    \end{compactenum}
\end{compactenum}
