\section{Video Compression}
\greenbf{Interlaced video format:} 2 temporally shifted half images \\
\graytext{$\rightarrow$ increase frequency, decrease spatial resolution} $\rightarrow$ not progressive\\
\greenbf{Lossy video compression:} take advantage of redundancy spatial correlation between pixels, temporal correlation between frames \\
\graytext{$\rightarrow$ basically drop perceptually unimportant details}\\
\greenbf{with optical flow:} Encode optical flow based on previous frame can cause blocking artifacts (if OF of 2 pixels point to same coordinate, there will be a hole somewhere), does not work well for lots of movement, fast movement and scene changes.\\
\graytext{If temporal redundancy fails $\rightarrow$ use motion-compensated prediction}\\
\greenbf{Types of coded frames:}\\
\bluebf{I-Frame:} Intra-coded frame, coded independently of all others\\
\bluebf{P-Frame:} Predictively coded frame, based on previously coded frame\\
\bluebf{B-Frame:} Bi-directionally coded frame, based on previous \& future
\subsection*{Block-Matching Motion Estimation:}
Is a type of temporal redundancy reduction\\
\greenbf{Motion Estimation Algorithm \graytext{ME}}
\begin{compactenum}
    \item Partition frame into blocks (e.g. $16 \times 16$ pixels)
    \item For each block, find the best matching block in reference frame
\end{compactenum}
Metrics for best match: \graytext{sum of differences or squared sum of diff.}\\
Candidate blocks: \graytext{All blocks in e.g. $32 \times 32$ pixel area}\\
Search strategies: \graytext{Full search, partial (fast) search}\\
\greenbf{Motion Compensation Algorithm \graytext{MC}}
Use the best matching of reference frame as prediction of blocks in current frame\\
\graytext{$\rightarrow$ gives motion vectors \& MC prediciotn error or residual (encode with conventionl image coder)}\\
\greenbf{Motion Vector:} relative horizontal \& vertical offsets of a given block from one frame to another\\
\graytext{Not limited to integer-pixel offsets, can use half-pixel ME to capture sub-pixel motion.}\\
\greenbf{Half-pixel ME (coarse-fine) algorithm:}
\begin{compactenum}
    \item Coarse step: find best integer move
    \item Fine step: refine by spatial interpolation and best-matching
\end{compactenum}
\greenbf{Advantages and disadvanages}\\
+ good, robust performance, one MV per block $\rightarrow$ useful for compression, simple periodic structure \graytext{(GoP)}\\
- assumes translational motion (fails for complex motion)\\
\graytext{$\rightarrow$ codes these frames/blocks without prediction} produces blocking artifacts\\
\greenbf{MPEG-GoP} IBBPBBPBBI dependencies between frames
\subsection*{Scalable Video Coding:}
Decompose video into multiple layers of prioritized importance: e.g. \\
temporal scalability: \graytext{Include B-frames or not}\\
spatial scalability: \graytext{Base resolution + upsampling difference}\\
SNR scalability: \graytext{Base with coarse quatizer + fine quantizer}\\
\greenbf{Benefits:} Adapting to different bandwidths, facilitates error resiliency by identifying more and less important bits.
