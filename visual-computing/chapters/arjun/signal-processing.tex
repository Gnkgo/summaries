\section{Signal Processing}
\subsection*{Supersampling}
We sample multiple times per pixel for the most accurate color. Final color of pixel averaged from the samples that fall into this pixel. 
We have different patterns like uniform, jittering, stochastic, poisson.\\
Lose high frequency information.
