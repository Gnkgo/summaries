\section*{Image Segmentation}
\subsection*{Complete segmentation}
Finite set of non-overlapping regions that cover the whole image $I = \bigcup_{i = 1}^{n} R_i$ and $R_i \cap R_j = \emptyset$ $\forall i, j, i \neq j$\\
\textbf{Thresholding:} simple segmentation by comparing greylevel with a threshold to decide if in or out.\\
\textbf{Chromakeying:} when planning to segment, use special backgroundcolor. (Problems variations due to lighting, noise, ... mixed pixels (hard $\alpha$-mask does not work)) $I_\alpha = |I - g| > T$
\subsection*{Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis:}
ROC curve characterizes performance of binary classifier Classification errors: False negative (FN), false positives (FP)\\
ROC curve plots TP fraction $\frac{TP}{TP + FN}$ vs FP fraction $\frac{FP}{FP + TN}$\\
TODO\\
\subsection*{Picxel connectivity}
TODO\\
\textbf{Connected component raster scanning:} scanning row by row, if foreground \& label if connected to other label, alse give new label. (second pass to find equivalent labels)\\
\textbf{Improve:} when region found, follow border, then carry on (contour-based method)
\subsection*{Region growing}
Start with seed point or region, add neighboring pixels that satisfy a criteria defining a region until we include no more pixels.\\
\textbf{Seed region:} by hand or automatically by conservative Thresholding\\
\textbf{Inclusion criteria:} greylevel thresholding, greylevel distribution model (include if ($I(x, y) - \mu^{2})^{2} < (n \sigma)^{2}$ and update $\mu$ and $\sigma$ after each iteration) color or texture information\\
\textbf{Snakes:} active contour, a polygon and each point moves away from seed while criteria is met (can have smoothness constraint) Iteratively minimize enery function $E = E_{tension} + E_{stiffness} + E_{image}$
\subsection*{background subtraction}
simple: $I_\alpha = |I - I_{bg}| < T$ better: $I_\alpha = \sqrt{(I - I_{bg})^T \Sigma^{-1} (I - I_{bg})}$ where $\Sigma$ is the background pixel appearance covariance matrix, computed seperately for each pixel.
\subsection*{Morphological operators}
Logical transformations based on comparison of neighboring pixels\\
\textbf{erode} delete FG pixels with 8-connected BG pixels\\
\textbf{dilate} every BG pixels with 8-connected FG pixel make a FG pixel\\
\textbf{Uses:} smooth regions, remove noise and artifacts.
